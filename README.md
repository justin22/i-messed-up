# I messed up

Shit happens. People do mess up things. 

The next time you mess up something, 

```
npm install i-messed-up
```

or 
```
yarn add i-messed-up
```

or

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/i-messed-up@latest/index.js">
```

After installing you are already feeling a little bit better.

Now, 

```js
import iMessedUp from 'i-messed-up';


console.log(iMessedUp());
```

and you get something that might make you feel better, a bigger mess up from history. 

An example. 

```

That's it.
